# Kairos - Claude Code Instructions

## Repository Visibility Exception

**⚠️ This repository is APPROVED to be PUBLIC**

**Approved by:** User (2025-12-06)
**Rationale:** Research/demo threat intelligence triage proof of concept

### Why This Exception Exists

Unlike other homelab repositories, kairos is:
- A proof-of-concept research project
- Intended for demonstration purposes
- Does NOT contain infrastructure details, network topology, or service locations
- Safe for public visibility

### Security Considerations

While this repository is public:
- ✅ All security tests still apply (5 tests passing)
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- ✅ No infrastructure documentation exposed
- ✅ Environment variables properly managed via .env (gitignored)

### Do Not Change

**Do NOT make this repository private** unless explicitly instructed by the user.

This is an intentional exception to the "all repositories private by default" policy.
