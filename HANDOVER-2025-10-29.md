# Handover Note - 2025-10-29

## Context: Kairos Threat Intelligence Triage System

**Location**: `/home/apth/kairos/`
**Deployment**: Running on naiad (local) + Render.com (cloud demo)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete - Starter Feeds Implemented

## What We Just Did

### Problem
Kairos had a cold-start problem on Render deployments:
- The "Deploy to Render" button worked perfectly
- Asked for webhook URL during setup ‚úÖ
- But **no RSS feeds were configured** ‚ùå
- Result: Demo instances had nothing to triage (bad first impression)

### Root Cause
- `feeds.txt` (144 feeds) was `.gitignored` (user-specific)
- Dockerfile only copied the `app/` directory
- Render deployments had no feeds at all

### Solution: Curated Starter Feeds (Phase 1)

Created `feeds-starter.txt` with 15 high-value threat intel feeds:
```
Priority 10 (CERTs): CISA, UK NCSC, CERT-EU
Priority 9 (CVEs): Exploit-DB, Packet Storm, SANS ISC
Priority 8 (Research): Cisco Talos, Check Point, DFIR Report
Priority 7 (News): Hacker's News, Bleeping Computer, Krebs, Dark Reading, SecurityWeek
```

**Why 15 feeds?**
- Fast initial load (~30-60 seconds)
- Good coverage of threat intel sources
- Immediate "wow factor" for demos
- Not overwhelming for new users

### Technical Changes

**Files Modified:**
1. **`feeds-starter.txt`** - NEW: Curated 15-feed starter pack
2. **`Dockerfile`** - Added: `COPY feeds-starter.txt /app/feeds-starter.txt`
3. **`app/main.py`** - Smart loading logic:
   - Checks for `feeds.txt` first (local docker-compose with volume mount)
   - Falls back to `feeds-starter.txt` (Render/cloud with no volume)
   - Logs which file is loaded for debugging
4. **`README.md`** - Updated documentation about starter feeds

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Local deployment: Uses `feeds.txt` (144 feeds, volume-mounted)
- ‚úÖ Render deployment: Uses `feeds-starter.txt` (15 curated feeds, baked in)
- ‚úÖ Tested locally - confirmed correct behavior

**Git Status:**
- Committed: `e1e093a` - "Add curated starter feeds for cloud deployments"
- Pushed to `origin/main`
- Render auto-deploy should be triggered

## Current State

### Local Deployment (naiad)
- Container: `kairos` running on port 8083
- Status: Healthy, using full `feeds.txt` (144 feeds)
- Database: 3.6MB at `/home/apth/kairos/data/triage.db`
- Working perfectly ‚úÖ

### Render Deployment
- **Pending**: Auto-deployment triggered by push
- **Expected**: Will rebuild with starter feeds included
- **Need to verify**: Deployment success + feeds loading

## What's Next

### Immediate (You're About to Do This)
1. **User is setting up Render MCP server** so you can:
   - Monitor the Render deployment
   - Check logs for "Loading feeds from feeds-starter.txt (default)"
   - Verify feeds are fetching
   - Confirm health status

### Phase 2 (Future Enhancement)
**Feed Management UI** - Add to web interface:
- List current feeds (name, priority, last fetch status)
- Add new feed form (URL, name, priority)
- Delete feed button
- Toggle active/inactive
- No API knowledge needed

This makes Kairos fully self-service for non-technical users.

## Important Context

### How Kairos Works
- **Purpose**: RSS triage platform for threat intel analysts
- **Workflow**:
  1. Fetches 100+ security RSS feeds (every 5 min)
  2. Presents items one-by-one for keyboard triage
  3. `A` = Alert (immediate Discord webhook)
  4. `D` = Digest (daily markdown report)
  5. `S` = Skip (mark reviewed, no action)
- **Stack**: FastAPI + SQLite + async/await + vanilla JS frontend
- **Deployment**: Docker containerized

### Integration with Homelab
- Part of threat intelligence stack on naiad
- Complements **NewsBot** (automated AI triage)
- Feeds into **Elastic Stack SIEM**
- Kairos = manual human triage interface

### Key Files to Know
- `app/main.py` - FastAPI app, routes, scheduler
- `app/database.py` - SQLite schema and queries
- `app/feed_fetcher.py` - Async RSS fetching (5 parallel workers)
- `app/webhook_handler.py` - Discord webhook queue with retry logic
- `feeds.txt` - Full feed list (144 feeds, gitignored)
- `feeds-starter.txt` - Curated starter pack (15 feeds, committed)

### Render Deployment Notes
- Free tier = ephemeral storage (data lost on restart)
- Service sleeps after 15 min inactivity
- Cold start = 30 seconds
- For persistent data: Upgrade to Starter ($7/mo)

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Local development
cd /home/apth/kairos
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f kairos

# Check which feeds file is loaded
docker-compose logs kairos | grep "Loading feeds"

# Check feed fetch status
curl http://localhost:8083/api/metrics

# Git status
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

## Questions You Might Have

**Q: Why not just ship with all 144 feeds?**
A: Too slow for demos (5-10 min initial load), overwhelming queue, resource-heavy on free tier.

**Q: Can users add more feeds on Render?**
A: Yes! Via API (documented in README) or via Render Shell to edit `/app/feeds-starter.txt`.

**Q: Does this affect local deployments?**
A: No! Local docker-compose still uses `feeds.txt` (volume-mounted, 144 feeds).

**Q: What if Render deployment fails?**
A: Check build logs for Dockerfile errors. The `COPY feeds-starter.txt` step should succeed.

## For Your Future Self

When you reload:
1. Check if Render MCP server is configured
2. If yes: Check Render deployment status immediately
3. If successful: Verify feeds are loading via logs
4. If issues: Compare local vs Render behavior
5. User might want Phase 2 (Feed Management UI) next

That's the context. Good luck! üöÄ
